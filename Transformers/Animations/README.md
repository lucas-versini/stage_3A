The files `Id_2D.gif` and `Id_3D.gif` show the evolution of the dynamics through the layers for $V_k = \alpha_k I_d$, $\alpha_k \geq 0$, with $d = 2$ and $d = 3$ respectively.

The files `Minus_Id_2D.gif` and `Minus_Id_3D.gif` show the evolution of the dynamics through the layers for $V_k = -I_d$, with $d = 2$ and $d = 3$ respectively.

The file `Minus_Id_k_2D.gif` shows the evolution of the dynamics through the layers for $V_k = -\alpha_k I_d$, $\alpha_k \geq 0$, with $d = 2$.

For all the animations, the matrices $Q_k$ and $K_k$ are chosen randomly.

The coloration of the points (orange or blue) indicates to which cluster each point eventually converges.

The files `Movie_review.gif` and `Movie_review_2.gif` show the evolution of the dynamics through the layers of a trained model for $V_k = \alpha_k I_d$, $\alpha_k \in \mathbb{R}$, for one review of the IMDb dataset. For `Movie_review_2.gif`, less words are displayed to have a more readable result.
