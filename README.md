# stage_3A

This repository contains the main scripts used during my internship at the [Chair for Dynamics, Control, Machine Learning and Numerics](https://dcn.nat.fau.eu/).

The folder `Generalization` corresponds to section 2. of my report, namely generalization bounds for neural ODEs. It contains various models, datasets, as well as scripts to train these models and analyze the results.

The folder `Transformers` corresponds to section 3. of my report, namely discrete-time Transformers, or more precisely self-attention. The different scripts allow to observe clustering results, and some animations can also be found there.

More details can be found in the README file of each of these two folders.
